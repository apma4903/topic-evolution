## üî¨ Methodology

### Data Source
189 academic project topics from a graduate course spanning 2013-2024, representing student-selected research areas in applied mathematics and computational science.

### Classification System

**Algorithm**: Maximum-overlap keyword matching
- Each topic is evaluated against comprehensive keyword sets for all categories
- Keywords are weighted by specificity (multi-word phrases score higher)
- Topics assigned to category with highest cumulative keyword score
- No "other" category used; 100% classification achieved through iterative refinement

**Keyword Development Process**:
1. Initial keyword sets derived from domain expertise
2. Iterative expansion based on unclassified topics
3. Validation through manual review of edge cases
4. Temporal keyword updates for emerging terms (e.g., "LLM" for 2024)

**Category Definitions**:

1. **Machine Learning & AI**: Neural networks, deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, NLP, transformers, LLMs, recommendation systems, clustering, classification
2. **Finance & Economics**: Portfolio optimization, options pricing, trading algorithms, market analysis, cryptocurrency, blockchain, economic modeling, behavioral finance
3. **Mathematics & Theory**: PDEs, differential equations, numerical methods, probability theory, Markov processes, game theory, optimization theory, spectral methods, mathematical modeling
4. **Social & Urban Studies**: Census analysis, demographic modeling, urban planning, transportation, social network analysis, policy modeling, migration studies
5. **Sports & Gaming**: Sports analytics, game theory applications, ranking systems, strategy optimization, esports, recreational mathematics
6. **Climate & Weather**: Climate modeling, weather prediction, environmental systems, carbon modeling, sustainability, climate migration, extreme weather
7. **Health & Medicine**: Medical diagnosis, epidemiological modeling, drug development, biomedical applications, public health, pandemic modeling
8. **Physics & Quantum**: Quantum computing, physical systems modeling, statistical mechanics, fluid dynamics, quantum algorithms, particle physics
9. **Technology & Computer Science**: Algorithms, data structures, cryptography, software systems, database design, network analysis, cybersecurity
10. **Creative Applications**: Music generation, artistic applications, entertainment technology, creative AI, multimedia systems

**Validation Metrics**:
- Inter-rater reliability through expert review of sample classifications
- Temporal consistency checks across similar topics in different years
- Domain expert validation of category assignments
- Edge case documentation for ambiguous topics

**Notable Classification Decisions**:
- "Deep nets and PDE" ‚Üí Machine Learning/AI (ML keywords dominated despite PDE content)
- "Using finite elements to model ice flow" ‚Üí Climate/Weather (application domain priority)
- "Image Processing using PDE based models" ‚Üí Machine Learning/AI (modern image processing context)

### Limitations
- Single-category assignment may oversimplify interdisciplinary topics
- Keyword-based approach sensitive to terminology choices
- Temporal keyword evolution may create classification inconsistencies
- Small sample size in individual years limits statistical significance
